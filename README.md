## Description

_Short_: 
Growing suite of proteomics simulations for educational purposes

_Long_:
A growing collection of protein separation simulations created to aid in 
  educating High School AP and early undergraduate biology students in the 
  underlying theory and process of common wet lab procedures without 
  requiring the use of expensive equipment.

## For Educators 
Our goal is to improve student learning with our simulation of protein separation and analysis tools. 
  The simulation is easy to use, free and fun and will help prepare students for lab experiments. 
  
When we started to test JBF with students to assess their learning outcomes, we entered an iterative 
  process of revising the problem sets that we have created to go along with JBF. 
  
We have also incorporated Bloom's taxonomy to clarify the learning goals for each aspect of 
  JBF Biology in Bloom: Implementing Bloom's Taxonomy to Enhance Student Learning in Biology by 
  Alison Crow, Clarissa Dirks and Mary Pat Wenderoth. 
  
We are still learning how to make JBF better by using student surveys after each trial, so please 
  don't hesitate to send us your suggestions to improve JBF. 
  
Finally, we would like to express our sincere gratitude for your interest by providing all the 
  materials that you need to get started right away.
